                    <p>
                        Aroma Coffee was founded by two musicians Paul McCarthy and
                        John Lennon while doing a tour for the Beatles. During the
                        tour both Paul and John would talk well up to the early
                        hours of the morning about what would make a great cup of coffee.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To overcome their fatigue, the two would brew a cup of this
                        coffee to come out on stage and play music to their might.
                        The recipe was the blueprint that become of Aroma Coffee with
                        the first shop opening on a humble street in a small town in
                        the 1970's to be the international chain today. This is
                        the strength that Aroma Coffee is built upon.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Today Aroma Coffee is enjoyed by all over the world by this
                        historic ingredient and whenever you sample a cup of our
                        brand, you too will agree that Aroma Coffee is the greatest
                        cup of coffee in the world.
